# permalinkify

It happens to all of us. We (or somebody else) copy a link from GitHub, but forget to use a permalink.
An arbitrary amount of commits later, we stumble on this link, and scramble to find the lines being linked.

It shouldn't be too hard (ðŸ¤ž) to take such a link, plus a date, and give us a permalink for it.

Todo: implement this here.
